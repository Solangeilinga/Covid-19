# Covid-19
This project explores the relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and socio-economic indicators using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python.  The goal is to understand whether factors such as GDP, social support, life expectancy, and freedom are correlated with the speed of COVID-19 spread across countries.
